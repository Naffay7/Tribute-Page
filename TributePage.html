        <h2>From a Mother's Sickbed to a Nation's Hope</h2>
        <div class="equal">
<p>Abdul Sattar Edhi’s journey began in hardship. At just 11, he became the sole caretaker of his paralyzed mother in their impoverished Gujarat home bathing, feeding, and comforting her with a child’s hands. The violence of Partition at 19 seared his soul as he stepped over corpses in Karachi’s streets, these scars birthed an unshakable vow: no human would suffer unattended. From his mother’s sickbed to a borrowed clinic, he carried the wounded world on his back, one life at a time.</p>

        <h2>The Ambulance That Built an Empire of Mercy</h2>
        <div class="equal">
<p>In 1951, a broken van bought with coins from beggars, widows, and orphaned children became Pakistan’s first free ambulance. Edhi drove it himself—washing the abandoned dead, treating patients on its seats, sleeping between calls. As the destitute gave their meager earnings (a laborer’s daily wage, a child’s saved candy money), his fleet grew: one rusted van became 1,800 lifesaving vehicles. Today, these ambulances rescue 2 million annually—each funded mainly by the poor, for the poor, their sirens a chorus of his unbroken promise: "No life is insignificant."</p>

<p>On July 8, 2016, Edhi passed at 88. Following his lifelong passion, his eyes were donated to two blind patients his final act of charity. Over 250,000 attended Pakistan's largest funeral as he was buried in the same $5 shroud used for the poor, while his 1,800 ambulances continued his mission.</p>
